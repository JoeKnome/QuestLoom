# Entity Types Array Purpose

- In ThreadForm.tsx, ENTITY_TYPES doesn't clearly justify its purpose. If it's just a collection of the EntityType values, that should be retrieved from the enum, or if it needs to be a subset, that should be a mor generally defined collection that clearly describes what subset it's targetting.
